Templates based on Tableau using dem_finance_data.csv, dem_candidate.csv and Sample_Data.csv as reference.
Graphics Template :  The idea on this template is  to demonstrate some  possible graphics in Tableau supporting  the following questions,  as follows:
1) How much money DEM raised on 2018 Senate campaign in US?
2) How much they got per state?
3) Which state raised more money?
4) How much money this state donates to other states campaign?
4) Which candidates received more donation from this state.
So, those questions were summarized in 3 Tableau graphics that I would like to show to the group tomorrow for discussion.
Unfortunately, Tableau do not allow me to attach the graphics here, in this sense I am just copying the header here, as follows:
Graphic I - DEM 2018 US Senate campaign raised $146M and California represents 44% - $ 63M  
Graphic II - 90 % of CA fundraising were donated to other states (around 65% - WI, TX, MO, NV, MT, AZ, OH, FL)  
Graphic III - About 65 % of CA fundraising out-of-state were donated to - (candidates on : WI, TX, MO, ND,NV,AZ, MA, MT)  
Graphic IV - Under Construction A Map demonstrating the amount donated by states.
