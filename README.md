Techniques

Github workflow: 
master, Felipe and Karen merging branches
Branch name: 
Issue-Number-Description

Create Issue card for new features, and give a milestone, and assign. You can create another issue card for bugs 

Protect master branch so that folks can’t accidentally merge to master. Assign a person to manage pull requests and manage conflicts

Before you commit to github, convert your Jupiter Notebooks to copy and paste your files into python files. The difference comparison is hard to determine with Jupiter files. All kinds of stuff in the Notebook that you don’t need to commit. 

Jupiter Notebooks for development, Python for github. Gitignore your .ipynb
